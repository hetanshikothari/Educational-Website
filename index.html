      <p class="f">The probability formula is defined as the possibility of an event to happen is equal to the ratio of the number of favourable outcomes and the total number of outcomes.</p>
       <p class="f">In the study of probability, an experiment is a process or investigation from which results are observed or recorded.
An outcome is a possible result of an experiment.A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in the experiment. It is usually denoted by the letter S . Sample space can be written using the set notation, { }.</p>
<pre class="t"><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Tossing a coin
Possible outcomes are head or tail.
Sample space, S = {head, tail}.</pre>   
<p class="f">Independent events: Two events are independent when the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event.
When we determine the probability of two independent events we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.
P(XandY)=P(X)⋅P(Y)</p>
<p>To find the probability of an independent event we are using this rule:</p>
<pre class="t">If one has three dice what is the probability of getting three 4s?

The probability of getting a 4 on one die is 1/6

The probability of getting 3 4s is:

P(4and4and4)=16⋅16⋅16=1216
When the outcome affects the second outcome, which is what we called dependent events.</pre>

<p class="f">Dependent events: Two events are dependent when the outcome of the first event influences the outcome of the second event. The probability of two dependent events is the product of the probability of X and the probability of Y AFTER X occurs.<br>

<center>P(XandY)=P(X)⋅P(Yafterx)</center></p>
<pre class="t"><strong>Example:</strong>What is the probability for you to choose two red cards in a deck of cards?

A deck of cards has 26 black and 26 red cards. The probability of choosing a red card randomly is:
P(red)=2652=12
The probability of choosing a second red card from the deck is now:
P(red)=2551
The probability:
P(2red)=12⋅2551=25102</pre>
<p class="f">Two events are mutually exclusive when two events cannot happen at the same time. The probability that one of the mutually exclusive events occur is the sum of their individual probabilities.<br>

<center>P(XorY)=P(X)+P(Y)</center></p>
<p class="f">An example of two mutually exclusive events is a wheel of fortune. Let's say you win a bar of chocolate if you end up in a red or a pink field.
</p>

<pre class="t">What is the probability that the wheel stops at red or pink?
P(red or pink)=P(red)+P(pink)
P(red)=28=14
P(pink)=18
P(redorpink)=18+28=38</pre>
<p class="f">Inclusive events are events that can happen at the same time. To find the probability of an inclusive event we first add the probabilities of the individual events and then subtract the probability of the two events happening at the same time.<p>

<pre>P(XorY)=P(X)+P(Y)−P(XandY)</pre>
<pre class="t"><strong>Example:</strong>What is the probability of drawing a black card or a ten in a deck of cards?
There are 4 tens in a deck of cards P(10) = 4/52
There are 26 black cards P(black) = 26/52
There are 2 black tens P(black and 10) = 2/52
P(blackorten)=452+2652−252=3052−252=2852=713
